# Jupyter Notebooks for the OLDP Project

This repository contains serveral Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to use data from the [Open Legal Data](https://openlegaldata.io/) project.

Python Examples:

- How to use the OLDP Python client: `client_demo`

- Train a N-gram model based on case text: `ngram_model`

- Use extract and add annotations (litigation values) to cases: `litigtation_value`

- Visualization data from the citation/references dump: `references`

- Publication statistics: `publication-stats`

- Topic modeling and topics over time: `topics`

$ python3 -m venv .venv

# ... or with uv
$  uv venv --python=3.12

# activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# install depdencies
# ... with pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


# ... with uv
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each notebook may have its individual dependencies. Please check the introduction inside the notebooks.
